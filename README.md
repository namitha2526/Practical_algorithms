# Practical Algorithms People Ignore

This repository is a curated collection of **useful but underrated algorithms** — the kind that quietly power real systems like ETL pipelines, schedulers, search engines, storage systems, and data platforms.

Most algorithm resources focus on DSA interview puzzles. This repo focuses on **practical techniques developers actually use** — with clear explanations, edge-case handling, and readable implementations.

## What’s inside
You’ll find algorithms related to:

- Streaming + batch data processing  
- Interval + range normalization  
- Hashing and probabilistic structures  
- Sampling and sliding-window analytics  
- Scheduling and dependency resolution  
- Text / string similarity  
- Graph + workflow logic  
- Search + indexing techniques  

Each algorithm includes:
- what problem it solves  
- where it’s useful in the real world  
- clean code  
- edge cases and pitfalls  
- time + space complexity  

## Why this repo exists
These algorithms rarely get taught well — yet they show up everywhere in production systems. This repo documents them **properly and practically**, so they’re easy to understand and reuse.

## Goal
Not competitive programming.
Not theory for theory’s sake.

Just **simple, powerful building blocks for real-world engineering.**
